# Schedule-m8
gr8 scheduling m8.

## Motivation
This is a mock of quartz-http for now, primary motivation being that
for local development the microservice takes too much memory. I also
noticed that it is very slow to start up and shut down. This replaces
the http service with something that makes more sense for developing.

## Future development
Just a quick throwtogeher, maybe I can finish the actual scheduling code
when I have the time.
